            <p class="card-text">
                Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an extension to the original SMTP protocol that was
                developed to support email sender validation. Here, the sender via different
                mechanism
                and modifiers can specify the IP address(es) that he or she is allowed to send mail
                from and the recipient can then check the DNS record and check whether the client
                IP is in that allowable list of IP address(es). Rather than directly specifying
                IP address(es), sender can also include a referral to another domain which means the
                receiver will have to look up the SPF record for the referred domain. <br><br>

                Now, imagine getting an email from <i>attack.com</i>. The attacker can set an
                infinite
                number of SPF referrals via <i>include</i> mechanism as its SPF record and
                try to launch a DoS attack either on your server
                by blocking your mail queue while keeping your mail server busy with a lot of SPF
                processing or on another server by using your mail server as a reflector. <br><br>

                This is why, RFC 7208 (<a
                    href="url">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7208</a>), provides a
                recommendation to the limit of DNS queries that
                needs to be made for SPF processing. This is a test website where you can have a
                look
                whether your server conforms to the limit or can the attacker misuse your server and
                launch a DoS attack?
